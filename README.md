# ddb-template-fullautomation-mulesoft
Template repo to demonstrate full automation for  MuleSoft. 

For CloudHub & Standalone general reference, use this repo ddb-mulesoft-project-repo-template to guide you.

This repo demonstrates a full deployment cycle, read the following 

1) Munit testing feature branches
2) Deploying to dev through pull requests from feature branch in to dev branch
3) Deploying MuleSoft code & API Manager related configurations to UAT through pull requests from feature in to release and installing the artifacts & build info to repository
4) Deploying to production through a workflow run on-demand basis, cron jobs configured in th workflow file for production deployment
5) The POM file in this project is for reference purpose - make sure to not copy everything and instead use the POM generated by Anypoint Studio and always use the latest version to be updated with the correct POM structure
6) Do not use SNAPSHOTS version in your POM, the default POM generated by Anypoint Studio includes SNAPSHOT that needs to be removed
7) Refer the POM file on how you can use properties section and declare externalized properties
8) Alerts automated here are for CloudHub deployments only, Standalone deployments follows NewRelic for Infrastructure & APM monitoring, TIF & Splunk for Transaction and Sys logs monitoring
9) Note that the MuleSoft targets provided in the actions files are for AWS instances and IDC instances, refer the MuleSoft documentation below explains how you can incorporate cloudhub but regardless, the procedure to deploy will to deploy will be the same
10) BDD Testing Framework incorporated for regression testing post UAT & PROD deployments, the testing framework is on a separate repository which is checked on the pipeline actions
11) For CloudHub, make sure to set the correct region and worker size, refer the below deployment guide for parameters for workerType and region
12) It is mandatory to set-up visualizer for both CloudHub and Standalone MuleSoft applications the three tags to be added in your POM file are the following
     `anypoint.platform.visualizer.layer=<name>` - for e.g, System, Process, Experience, Pub, Sub
     `anypoint.platform.visualizer.tags=<name>, <name>` - Should match with Anypoint Exchange Categories value
     `anypoint.platform.visualizer.displayName=<name>` - Should match with Runtime Manager Application Name
13) Post go-live check-outs on the API manager Instance updates for e.g. updated Implementation URL's, Consumer URls and API Instances on Anypoint Exchange are to be done by the API/Interface owner
